# One-pass assembler and emulator of hypothetical machine

## One-pass assembler

Construction and implementation of a one-time assembler for a instruction subset if a hypothetical machine. 

## Emulator

Construction and implementation of a part of static emulator which can recompile the program intended for a hypothetical machine, so that the emulation can be performed on x86 processors. Output from the one-pass assembler should be used as an input.

## Structure

Repository is organized as following:
- `doc` directory contains assignment as well as solution document(s)
	- `sp_dz1` directory contains assembler documentation 
	- `sp_dz1` directory contains emulator documentation 
- `source` directory contains code 
	- `sp_dz1` directory contains assembler source 
	- `sp_dz1` directory contains emulator source
